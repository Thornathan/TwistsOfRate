## About
______________________________________________________________________
Hello! 
We are Ryan Nash, Jonathan Lane and David Sheinbein, three individuals with a passion for gaming â€” gaming makes us happy. 
We truly believe in the power of collaboration and gamers ability to simplify communications, elevate experiences, and engage and inspire both game developers and gamers everywhere. 
Good games and good relationships come from collaboration. We're excited to implement a gaming oasis in which developers can have their games tested before release with honest feedback and also allow gamers to find games that they will be highly interested in. 
We hope this will allow us all to learn about all gamers prefrences, improve gaming as a whole and make the gaming community better together.
