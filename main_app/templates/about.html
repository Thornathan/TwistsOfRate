        <h2><strong>Hello!</strong></h2>
        <p> We're <strong>Ryan Nash, Jonathan Lane and David Sheinbein</strong>, three individuals with a passion
          for gaming â€” gaming makes us happy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          We truly believe in the power of collaboration and gamers ability
          to simplify communications, elevate experiences, and engage and inspire both game developers and gamers
          everywhere.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <strong> Good games and good relationships</strong> come from collaboration. We're excited to implement a
          <strong> gaming oasis </strong> in which developers can have their games tested before release with honest
          feedback and also allow gamers to find games that they will be <strong>highly interested</strong> in.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          We hope this will allow us all to learn about all gamers prefrences, improve gaming as a whole
          and make the <strong>gaming community better together.</strong>
